  <h2>East Tennessee Helene Relief Spreadsheet</h2>
  <p>There is an overwhelming flood of information about the needs that communities in East Tennessee and Western North Carolina are facing in the wake of hurricane helene.</p>

      <li>Shelters</li>
      <li>Medical care</li>
      <li>Resource distribution sites</li>
      <li>Volunteer needs</li>
      <li>Fundraisers</li>
    </ul>

  <h1>Get Involved</h1>
  <h2>Add information to our resource database</h2>
  <p>People from anywhere in the world can help us gather information about the needs of our communities. We are primarily collecting information about counties in East Tennessee as well as Western North Carolina.</p>

  <p>If you are on the ground and have learned about a new distribution center, donation spot, or other resource, share it using our <a href="https://forms.gle/zpTzGG6xAfJvN9dBA">online google form</a>.</p>

  <p>If you don't have direct access to events that are happening, you can still help us monitor and collect information. Here are some ways you can help:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Visit the county webpages for impacted counties in the region and make sure the sites for medical care, donations, shelter, and other services are all reflected in the spreadsheet. If you identify a new site, add it using our <a href="https://forms.gle/zpTzGG6xAfJvN9dBA">online google form</a>.</li>
    <li> Open our spreadsheet to the "donation drop-off" or "distribution center" tab. Under the "what donations are being accepted" or "what resources can be acquired" columns, identify undated or out of date reports. Then visit the social media of the site to see whether there is updated information available. If so, share it using the "report a change" section in our <a href="https://forms.gle/zpTzGG6xAfJvN9dBA">online google form</a>.</li>
    <li>Visit the social media or website of sites we have identified. They may be posting information about other related sites or fundraisers that we hadn't identified yet. Share that new information using our <a href="https://forms.gle/zpTzGG6xAfJvN9dBA">online google form</a>.</li>
    <li>Add fundraisers like Go Fund Me's, mutual aid requests, library funds, or similar using our <a href="https://forms.gle/zpTzGG6xAfJvN9dBA">online google form</a>.
  </ul>
