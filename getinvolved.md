  This is a publicly developed resource, and we can use your help! There are a few ways you can get involved.

# Add information to our resource database
Information is circulating primarily through social media posts and signal threads.

People from anywhere in the world can help us gather information. We are primarily collecting information about counties in East Tennessee as well as Madison County, North Carolina.

Help us build our database by sharing information about shelters, donation collection sites, distribution sites, and other location-specific resources for people impacted by the hurricane.

When you come across new information to add to our database, you can share it using an [online google form](https://forms.gle/zpTzGG6xAfJvN9dBA)

# Share breaking news 
If you live in the region and have new information about what's happening on the ground, we have a form for that too!

[Share current updates here](https://forms.gle/sfd62MmvYc1cewP57)

# Help us vet our data
We have a team of people reviewing and updating the data received through the online form. That data is reviewed before you ever see it in our public-facing sheet.

If you are interested in helping with data vetting, get in touch.
