# About the database
There is an overwhelming flood of information about the needs that communities in East Tennessee and Western North Carolina are facing in the wake of hurricane helene.

We are maintaining a public-facing spreadsheet that reflects what we know about:
* Shelters
* Medical care
* Resource distribution sites
* Volunteer needs
* Fundraisers

[You can view the spreadsheet here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16DEEWE94xntZb_m4bZ9JDtJhPNgqz8uHS81uTr-PLCI/edit?gid=845725146#gid=845725146)

We are also in the process of building a spreadsheet that has immediate needs and updates as we learn them. We'll share more as things develop!
