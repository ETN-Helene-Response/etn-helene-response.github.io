Hi! We are members or friends of Tri Cities Mutual Aid working together to organize information related to flood relief in east tennessee and some parts of western north carolina. 

Our main priority is to help volunteers identify and meet needs, and get information to the people who need it. 

Our project is crowdsourced, which means anyone anywhere can help! Open the About page to learn more.
